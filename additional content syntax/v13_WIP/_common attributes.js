/*	-WHAT IS THIS?-
	The script featured here is an explanation of how to make your own custom addition to MPMB's D&D 5e Character Tools.
	To add your own content to the Character Sheet, use the syntax below and save it in a file.
	You can then import this file directly to the sheet using the "Import" button and "Import/Export" bookmark.
	There you can either import the file as a whole or just copy the text into a dialog.

	-KEEP IN MIND-
	Note that you can add as many custom codes as you want, either by importing consecutive files or pasting the scripts into the dialog.
	It is recommended to enter the code in a freshly downloaded sheet or to first reset sheet.
	Thus you don't run the risk of things that have already been filled out causing conflicts.

	-HOW TO READ-
	Every line comes with a comment immediately after it to show whether it is // Optional // or // Required //,
	followed by a more explanatory comment

	-THIS IS JAVASCRIPT-
	The imports scripts work by creating a new entry inside an existing object or by calling functions.
	You can create new or overwrite existing global variables by omitting 'var'.
	You will need to understand the basics of JavaScript variables: strings, arrays, and JSON objects.
	Note that every opening symbol must have its closing counterpart: (), {}, [], "", ''.
	If these are not present, the code will give an error when imported.
	Use proper editing software for code (like Notepad++). Text processors like Microsoft Word will screw up your code.
	To help finding syntax errors, use (online) code checking software like https://jshint.com

	-COMMENTS IN THE EXAMPLE-
	Anything on a line after two forward slashes is a comment and will be ignored when running the code.
	Multiline comments are possible. Open them using the forward slash followed by an asterisk and close them with the opposite.
	The below contains a lot of these comments. The comments are not necessary for the script to work, so feel free to remove them.

	The entries in this array must always be arrays with 2 strings each:
	1. The first string in each sub-array is the type of action, written in lowercase.
		The options are "action", "bonus action", or "reaction".
	2. The second string can be one of two things:
		2.1	When the first character of the string is non-alphabetic (e.g. a space or a hyphen), it is amended to the name of the feature.
			This amended total is then added as an action.
			If you are also using the 'limfeaname' attribute, that string will be used instead of the feature's name.
			So this entry will be added to 'limfeaname' string.
		2.2 When the first character of the string is an alphabetic character (e.g. everything from a-Z), it is not amended to the name of the feature.
			The string is taken as-is and added as an action.

	2. String
		Works similar to the 1. Number option, except for class features.
		For class features the string is used in the "Class Features" section without changes.
		For example-
			usages : "Charisma modifier per ",
			recovery : "short rest",
		Will result in-
			"Charisma modifier per short rest"
	3. Array
		An array signals that the usages vary depending on level.
		Each entry is a level, so you will most likely want to add 20 entries.

		For skills, use the full name of the skill, or its 4-letter abbreviation (e.g. "Perc" for Perception).
		For saving throws, use the full name of the ability, or its 3-letter abbreviation.
		For initiative, use "Initiative", or "Init".
		For attacks, use "Attack", or "Att".
	2.	The second entry of each enclosed array is a boolean
		Set this to 'true' if you want to give advantage.
		Set this to 'false' if you want to give disadvantage.

	The Colourful sheets have checkboxes on the first page for both advantage and disadvantage for all
	skills, saving throws, initiative, and attacks.
	Using this attribute, you can set those checkboxes.
	The sheet will automatically determine if advantage, disadvantage, or neither should be checked (as they cancel each other out).
	Other effects from advantage/disadvantage are also taken into consideration,
	such as 5 being added to Passive Perception when the character has advantage on Perception checks.

	Although the Printer Friendly sheets don't have checkboxes for advantage/disadvantage,
	this attribute will still be taken into consideration for (dis)advantage on Stealth, and its effect on Passive Perception.

	If the magic items still requires components, you will have to manually set the 'components' and
	'compMaterial' attributes using this 'spellChanges' object.

	For example, you can use this attribute in a cleric class feature to change the casting time and range

		1)	type, a string with the type of the thing being processed.
			This can be one of three things:
				"dc"
				"attack"
				"prepare"

			Check against this to see if you are adding a number to the correct thing.
			For example, if you want to add 2 to the DC, but not to the spell attack
			or number of prepared spells, do the following:
				if (type == "dc") return 2;

		2)	spellcasters, an array of CurrentSpells object entry names.
			These entry names are identical to the source of the spellcasting.
			For example, it will be ["wizard"] if the thing to calculate is the wizard's spell DC/attack bonus/spells to prepare;

			Check against this if you only want to add a number to the spell save DC if a certain spellcasting class is present.
			For example, if you only want the spell DC of the cleric to be 3 higher:
				if (type == "dc" && spellcasters.indexOf("cleric") != -1) return 3;

		3)	ability, a number of the ability score being used.
			This can be one of seven numbers:
				0 = none, 1 = Str, 2 = Dex, 3 = Con, 4 = Int, 5 = Wis, 6 = Cha

			Check against this if you only want to change something if it is with a certain ability score.
			For example, if you want to add 1 to the spell attacks done with Charisma:
				if (type == "attack" && ability == 6) return 1;

				Note that this is only run for spell sheets generated using the spell selection dialog,
				it isn't used for 'complete' spell sheets.

		// 1st array entry //
		The function is fed three variables:
		1)	spList, an object that determines how the spell list will be generated.
			You can change this object to affect which spells are available.
			Note that this object determines the list of spells to choose from in the spell selection dialog,
			it does not determine what spells are selected, only what options are given to select spells from.

			The object will look as the 'common spell list object' explained in the file "_common spell list object.js".

			It will always contain the attribute 'extraspells', possibly as an empty array.
			The presence of all other attributes depends on what spell list is being generated.

			What you can do, for example, is limit the schools a class has access to by
			changing or adding the spList.school attribute.
			Or you can add spells to the list by adding them to the spList.extraspells array.
			Or you can remove spells from the list by changing or adding the spList.notspells attribute.

		2)	spName, a string that is the entry in the CurrentSpells object
			This string will be identical to whatever added the spellcasting feature.
			For example, this will be "wizard" for the wizard class spell list,
			"fighter" for the eldritch knight spell list,
			or "drow" for the racial spells gained from being a dark elf.

		3)	spType, a string that shows what type of spell list this is
			This can be one of multiple things:
			"book"	spellcasting class uses a spellbook (e.g. the wizard)
			"list"	spellcasting class prepares spells from a list (e.g. the cleric)
			"known"	spellcasting class has to select the spells it knows from a list (e.g. the bard)
			"feat"	spellcasting source is a feat and only gains spells from the spellcastingBonus feature
			"race"	spellcasting source is a race and only gains spells from the spellcastingBonus feature
			"item"	spellcasting source is a magic item and only gains spells from the spellcastingBonus feature

			It can also have de suffix "-bonus" added to one of the above if generating the list for
			something gained through the spellcastingBonus attribute.

		// 1st array entry //
		This function is called whenever a spell is added to the spell sheet,
		both when added manually and during spell sheet generation.
		You can use it to dynamically change something about a spell like its description, range, or school.
		This function is passed four variables:
		1)	spellKey, a string of the name of the entry in the SpellsList variable.
			Thus, you can find the original SpellsList entry with SpellsList[spellKey].

		2)	spellObj, the object of the entry which you can edit.
			This has the same attributes as a SpellsList entry, see the syntax file "spells (SpellsList).js".
			The only exception is that when using the metric system, both the 'description' and 'range' attribute
			will already have been converted into their metric versions.
			Also, it will have the `firstCol` attribute set to whatever the automation wants it to be and
			you can change it here to something else (e.g. change a 'checkbox' to a 'markedbox').

		3)	spName, a string that is the entry in the CurrentSpells object
			This string will be identical to whatever added the spellcasting feature.
			For example, this will be "wizard" for the wizard class spell list,
			"fighter" for the eldritch knight spell list,
			or "drow" for the racial spells gained from being a dark elf.
			This will be an empty string when the spell is added manually.

		4)	isDuplicate, a boolean that is true if the spell is a duplicate
			This is intended for spells that are added using the 'spellcastingBonus' attribute, but are also present on the spell list otherwise.
			For duplicate spells like this, the first time the spell is added,
			it is treated as the one gained from 'spellcastingBonus', and this boolean is set to false.
			Then, the second time this spell is added, it is treated as the one gained from the regular spell list and this attribute is true.


		By changing the attributes of the spellObj, you change what is put in the fields.
		Changing that object has no affect on the original SpellsList entry.

		This function is processed after the 'spellChanges' attribute.
		If you need to change only spells for one spellcasting source, use the 'spellChanges' attribute above.

		// 2nd array entry //
		This has to be a string and will be shown in the "Changes" dialog when this feature is added/removed.
		This explanation will also be available any time a change requires the re-generation of spell sheets.

			or "Init" for initiative,
			or "Too" for the optional tool/skill for which you can change the name,
			or "All" for the all skills modifier.
		b)	for "save" it can be the three-letter abbreviation of an ability score,
			or "All" for the all saves modifier.
		c)	for "" it has to be the exact name of the field as used in the PDF.
			common ones include:
			"Proficiency Bonus Modifier",	// modifier field for proficiency bonus
			"Passive Perception Bonus",		// modifier field for passive perception (not normal perception)
	3. mod
		This can be any combination of numbers, mathematical operators,
		and three-letter ability score abbreviations for ability score modifiers,
		or 'Prof' for the proficiency bonus.
		Additionally, you can use min(1|2) and max(1|2), which work like Math.min(1,2) and Math.max(1,2).
		Note that the pipe is used instead of a comma.

		For example, to add the proficiency bonus, Constitution modifier, and subtract 2, it would look like this:
			mod : "Prof+Con-2",
		Or, another example, to add 1, it would look like this:
			mod : 1,
		Or, another example, to add the Charisma modifier with a minimum of 1, it would look like this:
